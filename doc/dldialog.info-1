Introduction
************

   `Please don[acute ]t forget to read the frequently asked questions!
Thank You!'

   DLDialog was mainly developed for the `Deutsche Linux Distribution
(DLD) of delix Computer GmbH'.

   DLDialog offers the capability to draw a variety of widgets, in
order to ease the human user in feeding input to the script.  The
program is designed to be particularly useful to implement system
administration scripts.  I hope you will enjoy this program.

INSTALL
-------

   Basic Installation ==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

   The simplest way to compile this package is:

   1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and
type      `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If
you're      using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need
to type      `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to
execute      `configure' itself.

   Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
messages telling which features it is checking for.

   2. Type `make' to compile the package.

   3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
    the package.

   4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
    documentation.

   5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
with the distribution.

   Compilers and Options =====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:      CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

   Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
   env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

   Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

   Installation Names ==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `-prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `-exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `-bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure -help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `-program-prefix=PREFIX' or `-program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

   Optional Features =================

   Some packages pay attention to `-enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `-with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `-enable-' and `-with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `-x-includes=DIR' and
`-x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

   Specifying the System Type ==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`-host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `-target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `-build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

   Sharing Defaults ================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

   Operation Controls ==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

   `-cache-file=FILE'      Use and save the results of the tests in
FILE instead of      `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to
disable caching, for      debugging `configure'.

   `-help'      Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

   `-quiet' `-silent' `-q'      Do not print messages saying which
checks are being made.  To      suppress all normal output, redirect it
to `/dev/null' (any error      messages will still be shown).

   `-srcdir=DIR'      Look for the package's source code in directory
DIR.  Usually      `configure' can determine that directory
automatically.

   `-version'      Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the
`configure'      script, and exit.

   `configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.

General Syntax
==============

``//'` [lsqb  ][lt    ]comment[gt    ][rsqb  ]''
     DLDialog ignores the rest of the line after //.

``[num   ]'` [lsqb  ][lt    ]comment[gt    ][rsqb  ]''
     DLDialog ignores the rest of the line after [num   ].

```[lcub  ]'[lt    ]block[gt    ]`[rcub  ]'''
     block consists of multiple combinations of commands surrounded by
     braces.

``[lt    ]name[gt    ]''
     name is a single word or several words surrounded by parenthesis.
     A [amp   ] will specify the next letter as the shortcut for this
     item.

``"'`[lt    ]string[gt    ]'`"'
     "'`[lt    ]string[gt    ]'`"' Strings are concatenated like in
     ANSI C.

``[lt    ]varname[gt    ]''
     varname is a single word beginning with an alphabetic letter,
     which contains no special characters.

``[lt    ]value[gt    ]''
     value is a [lt    ]varname[gt    ], a [lt    ]name[gt    ] or a
     number.

``[lt    ]executable[gt    ]''
     executable is a filename that has the executable flag set and can
     be executed by e.g. `sh -c "[lt    ]executable[gt    ]"'.

     This file will be executed and the standard output of this file
     will be parsed and executed as a DLDialog program.

     Variables set with the executable will have global effect.

``[lt    ]command[gt    ]'`;''
     normal commands end with a semicolon.

What is this start stop for?
============================

   If you plan to display several dialogs in your session, it is useful
to start a dialog server with:
     if [ -z "$DLDIALOG_INFIFO" ]; then
       dld_waitforend="yes";
     fi
     
     function dldialog_start () $lcub;
       ret=$($DLDIALOG --start $@)
       ERR="$?"
       if [ "$ERR" != "0" ]; then
         echo Exited with $ERR
         exit 10;
       fi
       eval "$ret"
       export DLDIALOG_INFIFO
       trap dldialog_stop EXIT
       trap dldialog_stop SIGCHLD
       trap dldialog_stop SIGPIPE
     [rcub  ]
     
     dldialog_start $ARGS

   At the end of the script dldialog[lowbar]stop is now called, which
can look like this:
     function dldialog_stop () [lcub  ]
       if [ "$dld_waitforend" = "yes" ]; then
          $DLDIALOG --wait
          dldirname=`dirname "$DLDIALOG_INFIFO"`
          if [ -d $dldirname ]; then
            rm -fr $dldirname
          fi
       else
          $DLDIALOG --stop
       fi
     [rcub  ]

   All of these functions (and more) can be found in
dldialog[lowbar]funcs, which is in this documentation directory or in
the tests directory of the source package.

   You want the user to see, what is going on. OK here is an example:

     function infobox () [lcub  ]
       $(dldialog -q <<EOF
       dialog "Please wait...         " [lcub  ]
         text "$1";
         gauge -exit -exec "$2" ;
       [rcub  ]
     EOF)
     [rcub  ]
     
     infobox "Preparing the system" "echo 0;sleep 2;echo 50;sleep 2;echo 100;";
     
     function testf () [lcub  ]
     # Print the percent of completition
       echo 0;
     # Do s.th. useful :)
       sleep 2;
     # Print the percent of completition
       echo 50;
     # Do s.th. useful :)
       sleep 2;
     # Print the percent of completition
       echo 100;
     [rcub  ]
     
     declare -fx testf

How can I change elements depending on others?
==============================================

   Suppose you want to get the host name and domain name of a host. You
want to preset the domain name with the domain of the host name, once
the user has entered it.
     #!/bin/sh
     
     # Start the server
     result=$(dldialog --start $@)
     eval "$result"
     export DLDIALOG_INFIFO

             col [lcub  ]
               text "Hostname:";
               text "Domainname:";
             [rcub  ]
             col [lcub  ]
               input -var hostname -length 20 -exit;
               input -var domain -length 20;
             [rcub  ]
           [rcub  ]
           button "[amp   ]OK" -var OK -set "1" -exit;
       [rcub  ]

       fi

Why can't I see my list?
========================

   If no -width and -height is specified the element shows up with it's
smallest size.

   Remember: -width and -height are relative to the element with the
most inner [lcub  ][rcub  ]. The dialog element's width and height tags
are relative to the -geometry size (or as a default 600x400).

   Specifying -width and -height also gives dldialog a hint which
elements have to grow how much, if the dialog resizes.

   This one is ugly:
     dialog "Not so nice" [lcub  ]
       list "A very small list" [lcub  ]
         listitem "Item";
         listitem "Item";
         listitem "Item";
         listitem "Item";
         listitem "Item";
         listitem "Item";
         listitem "Item";
         listitem "Item";
         listitem "Item";
         listitem "Item";
         listitem "Item";
         listitem "Item";
         listitem "Item";
         listitem "Item";
         listitem "Item";
         listitem "Item";
       [rcub  ]
     [rcub  ]

   Here a nicer one:
     dialog "Not so nice" -width 100 -height 100 [lcub  ]
       list "A very small list" -width 100 -height 100 [lcub  ]
